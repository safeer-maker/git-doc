# Lets work on Semnetic version

The first thing is to create and issue and new branch.

## Semantic versioning

Semantic versioning is a way to tag your source based on the version number. 

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

-    **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
-   **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
-  **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
>   Additional labels for pre-release nd build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
